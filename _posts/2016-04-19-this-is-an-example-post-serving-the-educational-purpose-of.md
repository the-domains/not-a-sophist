description: "This is an example post, serving the educational purpose of helping me learn The Grid. Initial impressions are quite poor.  When the invite to beta appeared in my inbox this morning, I was exciting. Just today I had a project idea in which I could utilize The Grid. It was like a lesson in envisioning or synchronicity; I needed it and it appeared. But I didn't ask for seeming elementary stage of The Grid or it's difficult to figure out operation. Perhaps it's not difficult, perhaps it's features are just more limited then I'm aware. The point being, my excitement has turned to mild dismay.  I'm writing this post to see how it appears on my website. My last post appears to be the entirety of the sight, so I'm curious what will happen with the addition of text.   It's appearing that I will have to use The Grid as an interface more than a website. Due to it's focus on linking, I may just have to link my podcast and blog sites, which are independent, to The Grid as mediator.    "
